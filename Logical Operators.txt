1) Logical And operator
a = 10
b = 10
c = -10

if a > 0 and b > 0:
	print("The numbers are greater than 0")

if a > 0 and b > 0 and c > 0:
	print("The numbers are greater than 0")
else:
	print("Atleast one number is not greater than 0")

Output:
The numbers are greater than 0
Atleast one number is not greater than 0

a = 10
b = 12
c = 0

if a and b and c:
	print("All the numbers have boolean value as True")
else:
	print("Atleast one number has boolean value as False")

Output:
Atleast one number has boolean value as False

2)Logical OR operator
a = 10
b = -10
c = 0

if a > 0 or b > 0:
	print("Either of the number is greater than 0")
else:
	print("No number is greater than 0")

if b > 0 or c > 0:
	print("Either of the number is greater than 0")
else:
	print("No number is greater than 0")

Output:
Either of the number is greater than 0
No number is greater than 0
 
a = 10
b = 12
c = 0

if a or b or c:
	print("Atleast one number has boolean value as True")
else:
	print("All the numbers have boolean value as False")

Output:
Atleast one number has boolean value as True

3)Logical NOT operator
a = 10

if not a:
	print("Boolean value of a is True")

if not (a%3 == 0 or a%5 == 0):
	print("10 is not divisible by either 3 or 5")
else:
	print("10 is divisible by either 3 or 5")

Output:
10 is divisible by either 3 or 5
